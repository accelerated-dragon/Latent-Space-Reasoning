Use tone shifts (e.g., present vs. memory).  \n- **Build Rapport**: Allow moments where trust is established (shared stories, secrets).\n\n**Example Scene Flow**:  \n\"Present Day: 'So... my mom died at 50.'  \nPast Self: 'No one knows when you were born,' he says softly.\"  \n\n---\n\n### **Step 3: Explore Emotional Depth**\n- **Show Conflicts**: Highlight tensions (memory struggles, regret, doubt).  \n- **Include Personal Impact**: Ask questions about family, dreams, or unresolved issues that shape their current state.  \n- **Use Symbolism**: Incorporate objects (family heirloom, old letters) to deepen connection.\n\n**Example Question**: \"What does this letter say? Do you remember?\"\n\n---\n\n### **Step 4: Resolve the Conflict**\n- **Resolve Unresolved Themes**: Address key emotions (love, loss, growth). Avoid clich\u00e9s if allowed.  \n- **Add Layers**: Leave open-ended reflection for later development.  \n- **End on a Strong Note**: Show progress toward their goals (reconciliation, healing, new beginnings).\n\n**Final Thought**: \"As we look forward, do we still believe in our shared humanity?\" \u2014 This sets up possibilities for further exploration.  \n\n--- \n\nThis approach allows readers to empathize while building a compelling, emotionally resonant story.
