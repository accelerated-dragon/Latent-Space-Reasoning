  "output": "Here\u2019s a **detailed, actionable step-by-step plan** to determine why a programming language succeeds in gaining adoption:\n\n---\n\n### **1. Strong Ecosystem & Developer Support**\n- **Rich Documentation**: Provide comprehensive guides (code samples, tutorials, FAQs).  \n  *Example*: Languages like Python use \"official docs\" with official repositories.  \n- **Extensive Tooling**: Include integrated development environments (IDEs), build automation (e.g., Jenkins CI/CD), code editors, version control systems (Git).  \n- **Active Community**: Engage communities via forums, GitHub discussions, social media.  \n\n---\n\n### **2. Excellent Performance**\n- **Speed vs. Complexity**: Optimize for fast execution (e.g., JavaScript/C++).  \n- **Efficiency Features**: Language-specific optimizations (e.g., Rust's ownership model) enhance productivity.  \n\n---\n\n### **3. Comprehensive Learning Resources**\n- **Clear Syntax & API**: Simple syntax and intuitive APIs reduce learning barriers.  \n- **Examples & Practice**: Code snippets and real-world projects to demonstrate usage.  \n\n---\n\n### **4. Scalable Architecture**\n- **Cross-platform Compatibility**: Work seamlessly across operating systems and frameworks.  \n- **Modular Design**: Allow reuse of components without dependencies, reducing complexity.  \n\n---\n\n### **5. Cost-Effectiveness**\n- **Affordable Tools**: Minimize upfront costs while maintaining quality.  \n- **Free/Pro Options**: Offer open-source solutions where needed.  \n\n---\n\n### **6. Security Focus**\n- **Built-In Safety**: Protect against vulnerabilities (e.g., Java\u2019s security practices).  \n- **Regular Updates**: Address potential risks proactively.  \n\n---\n\n### **7. User-Friendly Onboarding**\n- **Simplified Integration**: Easy setup, minimal configuration.  \n- **Training Opportunities**: Workshops, mentorship programs, certifications.  \n\n---\n\n### **8. Rapid Innovation**\n- **New Features & Improvements**: Keep up-to-date with emerging technologies.  \n- **Feedback Loops**: Regular updates based on developer feedback.  \n\n---\n\nBy addressing these areas, a programming language can retain or even increase its popularity among developers globally.",
