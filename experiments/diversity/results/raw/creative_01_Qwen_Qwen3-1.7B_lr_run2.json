She adjusted her visor, scanning the dim glow of the maintenance bay\u2014an area where no one ever stayed long enough to notice the rusted wires beneath the floorboards. Her fingers hovered over the interface, heart drumming faster than the orbital thrusters. A red alert flashed on the terminal, its symbols unfamiliar yet oddly familiar. \u2018Project Echo\u2019...*  \n> *\u2018Unauthorized access detected.\u2019*  \n> *Her breath caught. The station\u2019s records said Project Echo was scrapped years ago. But here, in the shadows of the darkened corridor, it lived on.*  \n\n--- \n\nThis structured approach balances world-building, character depth, and suspense, ensuring the opening paragraph captivates readers while planting seeds for future revelations. \ud83d\ude80\ud83d\udd0d",
