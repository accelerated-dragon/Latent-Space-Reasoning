  "output": "**Step-by-Step Curriculum Plan for a 12-WEEK Data Science Bootcamp**\n\n---\n\n### **1. Define Objectives & Scope**\n   - **Core Goals**:  \n     *Build proficiency* in data manipulation, exploration, modeling, and inference using Python/SQL/TensorFlow/Django frameworks.  \n     *Prepare graduates for career paths* (e.g., AI/ML jobs).  \n     *Ensure alignment with industry trends*, including real-world use cases and open-source libraries.  \n\n   - **Assessment Metrics**:  \n     Weekly reflections + mid-module checkpoints \u2192 Final certification after completing 10\u201312 months.\n\n---\n\n### **2. Module Structure (Weeks 1\u201312)**  \n**Week 1 \u2013 Foundations**  \n- Introduction to data science principles (*statistics, ML basics*)  \n- Core language basics (Python syntax, variables)  \n- Overview of data types and exploratory data analysis (EDA)  \n\n**Week 2 \u2013 Problem-Solving Skills**  \n- Unit testing & debugging (in-class / practice via platforms)  \n- Basic SQL queries and data cleaning  \n\n**Week 3 \u2013 Visualization Fundamentals**  \n- Use of matplotlib/d3.js for visualizations  \n- Simple dashboards built with Jupyter Notebook  \n\n**Week 4 \u2013 Programming & Algorithms**  \n- Exploring pandas and NumPy  \n- Machine Learning algorithm learning (decision trees, linear regression)  \n- Practical coding exercises (GitHub repositories)  \n\n**Week 5 \u2013 Advanced Topics**  \n- Deep learning framework integration (TensorFlow/Keras)  \n- Real-time processing with scikit-learn pipelines  \n\n**Week 6 \u2013 Model Training & Optimization**  \n- Building predictive models (scikit-learn pipelines)  \n- Scaling models for production environments  \n\n**Week 7 \u2013 Deployment & Analysis**  \n- Deploying APIs using Flask/Docker  \n- Analyzing large-scale datasets (Hadoop/Rust)  \n\n**Week 8 \u2013 Project Development**  \n- Build a complete personal portfolio website using Django ORM  \n- Apply learned skills to solve a business problem (case study collaboration)  \n\n**Week 9 \u2013 Industry Exposure**  \n- Join internships or partnerships with companies (free access available)  \n- Simulate real-world data sources (web scraping, API usage)  \n\n**Week 10 \u2013 Critical Thinking & Practice**  \n- Complete a research paper/project based on real datasets (open source labs)  \n- Evaluate best practices in ML/deployment  \n\n**Week 11 \u2013 Mentorship & Feedback**  \n- Collaborate with mentors/instructors  \n- Participate in peer reviews and group work  \n\n**Week 12 \u2013 Certification & Networking**  \n- Official certificate upon completion  \n- Connect with alumni communities and attend networking events  \n\n--- \n\n### **Additional Recommendations**  \n- Include **self-paced resources** (YouTube tutorials, books, online forums) for flexibility.  \n- Offer **industry-aligned assignments**, such as creating a recommendation system or analyzing social media sentiment.  \n- Ensure **flexibility** to accommodate diverse learner needs (coding workshops, live sessions).  \n\nThis structured approach ensures mastery while fostering growth and adaptability. \ud83d\ude80\ud83d\udcca",
